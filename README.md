# Minecraft Virtual Intelligence

Welcome! This is a package intended for research into virtual intelligence in Minecraft.

## What is "virtual intelligence"?

By virtual intelligence, we mean "artificial intelligence that exists within a virtual world."

## Why Minecraft?

Minecraft offers a diverse, creative, and challenging virtual environment. While it is far from a perfect simulator for the real world  (it's a video game...),
we believe that it is a close enough approximation that methods that work here may have the potential to work in the real world.

## How can I contribute?

If you would like to contribute to the project, you can start by  forking the repository and adding things there. Then submit a PR and we will review your work to see if it fits with what we are trying to accomplish. If you have ideas you think may benefit the project, feel free to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/thomashopkins32/Minecraft-Virtual-Intelligence/issues).

## State of the Project

We are still early in the planning and development phase of the project. The first goal is to develop visual perception and curiosity while restricting the agent to only move through the environment.

## Installation

If you want to get started working with the project, we _highly_ recommend using a new Anaconda environment and installing from the [requirements](https://github.com/thomashopkins32/Minecraft-Virtual-Intelligence/blob/main/requirements.txt).

The official MineDojo distribution as of writing this is no longer maintained and package versions aren't frozen which can lead to compatability errors. Because of this, we recommend installing the [forked version of MineDojo](https://github.com/thomashopkins32/MineDojo).

## Technologies

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [MineDojo](https://minedojo.org/) (custom fork [here](https://github.com/thomashopkins32/MineDojo))
