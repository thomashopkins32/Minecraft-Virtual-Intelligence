    Used to store a single trajectory.

    A single item in a trajectory contains the following information:
    - The visual features computed from the observation of the environment
    - The action taken given the features computed
    - The reward given by the environment for the PREVIOUS action
    - The value assigned to the features computed
    - The log probability of sampling the action taken

    Note: a single item is not complete enough information to learn from.
    At least two consecutive items in the trajectory are necessary for learning.
    This is because the next observation and reward are not available until the next step is stored.
